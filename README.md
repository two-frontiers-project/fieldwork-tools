# Two Frontiers Project Fieldwork Tools

A central location for open fieldwork tool development and sharing for the [Two Frontiers Project](https://twofrontiers.org/).

-----------------

We are living through a revolution in computation, communications, microelectronics, sensors, microscopy, and DNA sequencing. These technologies are opening up new possibilities for field and lab work in novel and innovate ways, and by more diverse groups and people. 

This repository is a (somewhat idiosyncratic) selection of customized and validated tools we use in our microbiome field expeditions. 

We include devices we have developed and adapted, links to other's projects we appreciate and would like to share, and to commercial products that meet a need. Most are Open Hardware/Open Source, inexpensive (often in absolute terms, but at least compared to previous technology), and well suited for lightweight exploration and discovery. Many are quick hacks and works in progress. 

These tools lower barriers for microbiome exploration, and open many frontiers to citizen scientist and agile scientific expeditions.  

We welcome your input, tips, and suggestions, by pull requests or via email to "info \<at\> twofrontiers \<dot\> org".

## Field microbiology 

- [OD600](./OD600/) our custom designed minimal spectrometer for enrichment and culture growth measurement
- Microscopy:
  - PUMA microscope system developed by [Paul Tadrous](https://github.com/TadPath/PUMA) _(our custom remix coming soon!)_
  - [SWIFT M3-B](https://swiftoptical.com/products/m3-b) for a more costly (and heavier) field microscope that is built like a tank

## Field sequencing

- [Dremalfuge](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1483) for quickly pelleting cells
- [mag HMW DNA prep kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/quick-dna-hmw-magbead-kit)
- [MinIon Mk1](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-6037-4_10) and [field kit](https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/field-sequencing-kit.html)

## Field sampling

- [Folding sample site imaging stand](./sample-site-pyramid/) for mounting cell phones for consistent image and spectral data acquisition
- [CualID](https://github.com/johnchase/cual-id) unique and human readable samples IDs (pre-printed on full-sheet Cryo-Babies labels before expedition departure) 
- Convertible (leur-lock to open barrel) [syringes](https://meritoem.com/product/ex20-sdp/) for flexible sampling of materials in the field
- [Zymo DNA/RNAshield](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/dna-rna-shield) for preserving samples for sequencing

## Field sensors and digital communications

- [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) Long distance LoRa mesh networking for field team GPS tracking and text communication as well as datalogging
- IO Rodeo Arduino-based [pH meters](https://iorodeo.com/products/phfeatherwing) and [potentiostats](https://iorodeo.com/products/rodeostat-feather-wing)
